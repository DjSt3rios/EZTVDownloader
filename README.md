# EZTVDownloader
A simple software that allows you to download entire seasons with a few clicks from EZTV

The first thing you want to do when you first open the software, for the first time only, is to click "Setup magnet links".
A little window with instructions will open.

After that, select a show through the Show list in the web browser (Click the show you want)
Then select the seasons you want to download, through the two boxes next to the URL bar.

In the bottom part of the software, you will find a "Download" button and an option to download the episodes in HD, if they exist.
That's pretty much it. Happy downloading!
